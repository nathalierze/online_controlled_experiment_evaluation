Online-controlled experiment evaluation

Digital learning platforms are more and more used in blended classroom scenarios in Germany. 
However, as learning processes are different among students, adaptive learning platforms can offer personalized learning, e.g. by individual feedback and corrections, task sequencing, or recommendations. 
As digital learning platforms are already used in classroom settings, we propose the transformation of these plat-forms into adaptive learning environments. 
To measure the effectiveness and improvements achieved through the adaptions an online-controlled experiment design is created. 
In our experiment, we therefore investigate the effectiveness of different inter-ventions on a large user group in a four-month online-controlled experiment. 
For this purpose, the highly frequented German learning platform Orthografietrainer.net was transformed into an adaptive learning platform and users were randomly assigned to different interventions.
